      <strong>Step 1:</strong> In a separate bowl, rinse the rice several times
      with cold water so that the last water is transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Rinse and dry the boneless lamb with a napkin.
      Then cut the meat into small cubes. Peel the onion and chop three onions
      into thin quarter rings. Chop the carrots into strips. Peel the garlic
      heads from the outer husk
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Pour vegetable oil into the cauldron and heat it
      so that a light smoke appears. Fry in oil until golden brown, a whole
      peeled onion, and then remove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Now prepare a zirvak for Uzbek pilaf. Transfer
      the chopped onion into the heated oil and fry it while stirring for 5-7
      minutes so that it turns dark golden in color, but does not burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Then transfer the pieces of lamb to the fried
      onion and fry them for 10-15 minutes so that the pieces become ruddy on
      all sides. Fry everything over high heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong>Next, transfer the chopped carrots to the cauldron
      and fry it for 3 minutes without stirring. After three minutes, mix all
      the ingredients with a spatula and cook the zirvak for another 10 minutes.
      Rub the coriander and cumin in your palms or in a mortar and pour this
      mixture into a cauldron. Add dried barberry and salt to your taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong> Fry the meat with vegetables and spices until the
      carrots are soft. Then pour boiling water into the cauldron 2 cm above the
      meat level and simmer the zirvak already on low heat for 1 hour. You can
      add hot pepper to the zirvak according to your taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 8:</strong> After an hour, lay an even layer on top of the
      washed rice. Then increase the heat to maximum and pour boiling water
      through the skimmer or along the wall of the cauldron. The water level
      should be 3 cm above the rice layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 9:</strong> When the rice has absorbed all the liquid, press
      two garlic heads into it (only up to half), make the fire minimal and
      simmer the pilaf under a closed lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 10:</strong> After 10 minutes, tap on the wall of the
      cauldron with a slotted spoon, and if the sound is muffled, then in the
      pilaf make punctures to the bottom of the cauldron with a stick to remove
      steam through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 11:</strong> Then put a flat plate on top of the rice, and
      close the cauldron with a lid. Cook the pilaf for another 20-30 minutes on
      low heat. Then remove the garlic heads, mix the pilaf and remove the
      sample. Uzbek pilaf in a cauldron is ready. You can serve it to the table.
