    <h1>The Garden</h1>
    <h2>BY H.D</h2>
    <p>
      You are clear<br />
      O rose, cut in rock,<br />
      hard as the descent of hail.<br />
      <br />
      I could scrape the colour <br />
      from the petals<br />
      like spilt dye from a rock.<br />
      <br />
      If I could break you <br />
      I could break a tree....
