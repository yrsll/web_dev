And thanks to the reduced area of the TrueDepth camera, there is now more image space on the display.   Apple has developed a completely new camera layout and deployed the lenses at 45 degrees. Thanks to this, the best system of two cameras with an enlarged matrix of a wide-angle camera fit inside the case. In addition, space was freed up for an optical image stabilization system with a matrix shift, and the speed of the matrix on an ultra-wide-angle camera increased. The new ultra-wide-angle camera sees more detail in the dark areas of the image. The ultra-wide angle camera also provides a large field of view, even when you are very close to the subject. So you don\\'t have to step back to get everything you need into the frame.   Just start recording the video. The \"Movie Effect\" mode will keep the focus on the subject, creating a beautiful blur effect around it. The \"Movie Effect\" mode recognizes when it is necessary to shift the focus to another person or object that appeared in the frame. Now your videos will look like a real movie. Night mode automatically adjusts the shooting parameters. Even in low light, bright, clear photos with incredibly rich colors are obtained. Portrait mode artistically blurs the background to draw more attention to the subject. Six lighting effects will open up a wide scope for creativity. Now the Smart HDR 4 mode recognizes up to four people in the frame and optimizes contrast, lighting and even skin tone individually. With it, everyone will look their best. Deep Fusion technology helps with medium and low light levels. It analyzes each pixel in several images taken with different exposures so that the final photo shows barely distinguishable textures, the finest patterns and the smallest details. Photographic styles allow you to make your photos more expressive. But, unlike filters, styles are applied individually for each area of the photo, without changing the skin tone of people. The A15 Bionic processor and TrueDepth camera also enable Face ID, an incredibly reliable authentication technology. The built—in memory of the iPhone 13 is 128 GB - there is enough space for all important photos and videos. Apple iPhone 13 runs on battery power for 2.5 hours longer than previous versions.'\n}, {\n  id: 3,\n  name: 'Phone Standard',\n  price: 299,\n  description: ''\n}];\n/*\r\nCopyright Google LLC.
